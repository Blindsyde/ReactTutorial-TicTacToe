# ReactTutorial-TicTacToe

Went through the tutorial on how to create a tic tac toe game, I initially set up the tutorial for use in Visual Studio 2019 so the template came with some other functions, I added the game link to the main page links, added some styles, and changed some of the default template functions. 

I'll continue to use this repo for playing with and learning react while using .NET Core.
